# A fabric mod that simplifies using the vanilla crossbow

### Dependencies

- Fabric API
- Cloth Config
- Mod Menu

### Features

- Automatically swaps fireworks crafted with stars into the offhand while drawing the crossbow (if the player has any)
- Shoots the crossbow immediately after it is fully drawn
- Config menu to enable/disable features

### Compatibility

The mod should be compatible with all mods, and may even be compatible with mods that add custom crossbows, provided they extend the CrossbowItem class

It's fully client-side, so it will work on servers without the mod installed (although it may be considered cheating, see disclaimer)
